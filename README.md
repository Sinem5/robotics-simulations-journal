# Robotics-Simulations-Journal

## Week 0 - Starting and Explanations

### Purpose:
As far as I know, there is no journal entry specifically for robotics, even though many people are sharing information about it. Learning robotics is a challenging and lengthy journey, and I have a strong desire to pursue it. I have decided to share every step of my journey, including my struggles. 
Although I haven't recently started learning robotics from scratch, I have faced setbacks, made mistakes, and experienced a lack of motivation due to my fear of failure. However, I am no longer letting these obstacles stop me from achieving my goals. I want to share my journey with everyone to let you know that you are not alone in this process.

### What We Will Learn:
I am planning to learn Isaac Sim and Webots simulation technologies. I will focus on improving my skills in C++ and Python, but initially, I will primarily use Python since I am more familiar with it. Most of this repository will involve project-based learning, so there may not be a clear path at the beginning; however, I will organize my learning according to my project ideas.
If you are new to robotics, don’t worry! I will include all the necessary documentation and links to help you get started. I will also be learning from scratch for some of them, so we can explore together. Additionally, if you have any extra information or resources related to this topic, please don’t hesitate to contribute or reach out with any ideas or suggestions.

### Who Are You:
I am an enthusiast working in computer vision and robotics, and I am currently studying statistics. Over the past few years, I have decided to share my journey of self-discovery, and with this repository, I will be documenting my professional career for the first time. So let's start!
