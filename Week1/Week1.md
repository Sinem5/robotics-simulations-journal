## Week 1 Starting With Isaac Sim

This week marks the beginning of my robotics simulation journey, starting with Isaac Sim a powerful, now open-source robotics simulator originally developed by NVIDIA, used for developing and testing robotics algorithms in realistic virtual environments.
This week, I’ll walk through the basics of getting started including how to set up the environment, place a cube and a Jetson Nano robot into the scene, and move the Jetson around the cube. We’ll also connect Jetson's camera to RViz and, finally, collect synthetic data from Isaac Sim.

For installing instructions, you can use this link as referanse which also includes some examples about Isaac Sim: </br>

Here is the official documentation for Isaac Sim. I will mostly use this source as reference: </br>

For Ros2 you can follow the official documantation to create a workspace. I will use a workspace that I create with the name 'ros2_ws' : </br>
