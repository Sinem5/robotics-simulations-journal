## Week 10 Exploring Isaac Lab & Robotics Fundamentals

This week, I will provide documentation for downloading Isaac Lab, along with some valuable lessons for learning concepts in robotics and understanding Isaac Lab itself. We will also continue working on the project I started in the earlier weeks, and I will focus on fixing any issues related to that. 

This week is going to serve as a bit of a restart, so I will only be taking small steps forward. As I mentioned on LinkedIn, I recently completed another project, so after this week, I will shift my attention to enhancing my current project now that everything else has been wrapped up.



[This one is Isaac Lab's original documentation.](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html)

[This one is for downloading Isaac Lab. It's from the original documentation. ](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/quickstart.html) 

[And this one is the tutorial's documentation for learning how to use Isaac Lab.](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/tutorials/index.html) 


These steps are not included in the documentation, but they are crucial.

```
conda activate env_isaaclab 
# Source the Isaac Sim conda setup (this is crucial!)
source ~/isaac/setup_conda_env.sh 
```

These three playlists are for learning about Isaac Lab and for learning some concepts about robotics:

I am currently in the process of learning about robotics concepts and exploring IsaacLab. I will continue to study these topics and work on improving my project by applying what I learn. This week, my focus is primarily on reviewing documentation and helpful playlists. I hope to provide more updates about my work next week. If you have any recommendations for great playlists or documentation, please feel free to share them!
